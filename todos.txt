Overview:
Create a task management system where users can create tasks, assign them to specific categories or projects, set deadlines, and track their progress. This can be useful for personal productivity or team collaboration.

Key Features:

User Authentication: Implement user registration and authentication using Django's built-in authentication system or a third-party package like Django AllAuth.

Task CRUD Operations: Allow users to create, read, update, and delete tasks. Each task should have attributes such as title,
                         description, deadline, priority, status (e.g., pending, in progress, completed), and category.

Task Categories/Projects: Implement the ability for users to organize tasks into categories or projects. 
                            Users should be able to create, edit, and delete categories/projects.

User Permissions: Define permissions so that users can only access, modify, and delete tasks and categories/projects that they own.

Task Filtering and Sorting: Allow users to filter tasks based on various criteria such as status, priority, deadline, and category. Implement sorting options to sort tasks based on different attributes.

RESTful API: Build a RESTful API using Django REST Framework to expose endpoints for creating, updating, deleting, and retrieving tasks and categories/projects. Use serializers to convert Django model instances into JSON format.

Pagination: Implement pagination for the API endpoints to improve performance when dealing with large datasets.

Testing: Write unit tests and integration tests to ensure the reliability and functionality of your application. Use Django's testing framework or tools like pytest.

Frontend (Optional): Develop a frontend interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (you can use frameworks like Vue.js or React.js if you're comfortable with them) to interact with the backend API. This will give you experience in building a full-stack application.

Documentation: Document your API endpoints, request/response formats, authentication methods, and any other relevant information for future reference.

Checkpoint Ideas:

Set up your Django project with the necessary directory structure.
Create models for tasks, categories/projects, and user profile if needed.
Implement user authentication and authorization.
